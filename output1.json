So I hope this brings a little awareness that many of us housewives are chronically ill, and that's one of the reasons why we stay home. I get so many \"why don't you just work\" comments - first, I don't need a reason to stay home. But secondly I do have a really good reason \ud83d\ude05 #tradwife #chronicallyill #chronicillness "

You know, New York Times came out, spent the day with me, did a full photo spread, so that was huge. Yeah. And like, all the TV shows are featuring. I'm the number one book right now in religious leaders biographies. But we've been in the top 100 since the. It's. Since it got released. I'm sure that's all pre sales. So tell us how the Mormon Church legal disputes in Bad Mormon are all converging. Uh, when Heather, uh, decided she wanted to write a book, we, uh, filed for. For a trademark, and I was not expecting any. Any opposition, but the church. Mormon church filed an opposition to block the bad Mormon trademark, claiming a likelihood of confusion with the Mormon name.",

I don't know. No. Also for the confusion it would potentially cause my children. I would never wanna have to put them through that twice. Do you know what I mean? So like, we were married, we had kids, we had a family, we broke up, everybody healed from that. To then get back together. At the risk of then what if you break up again? Putting your kids through all that again? No, it's done. Enclosed. We're done, done, done, done. I hope one day we can be friends in cordial. Cause that would just be easy since we literally have children in common. But as far as ever being in a relationship with that person again, literally never. Over my fucking dead body."

And buying some eggs and toilet paper and basics, then this is not a man. This is a child. He is not fully grown. He's not fully raised. He's like a puppy who isn't ready to leave the litter yet. Maybe his mama was busy and didn't have time to teach him basic life skills. He probably also doesn't know how to turn on the washing machine or fix himself a sandwich. My advice is let's all stop breeding with nincompoops. Wait for a real man."

And of course, being a family man of six, family necessities and other commitments do not exactly allow much time. As it is, I find myself listening to music a lot while also doom scrolling TikTok, where I come across numerous videos of your podcast. If you're doom scrolling TikTok, your 20 minutes turns into two hours real fucking quick. So prioritize a set day. Every Wednesday from 8 to 10:00. At night, you're off limits. Put your phone on do not disturb. Put the kids to bed and go do something for yourself. Go read a book, go tinker with something in the garage. Go to the gun range, go play video games if that's what makes you happy. Every Wednesday from 8 to 10:00. You not having a hobby and you not having a reason to, like, exist other than work and taking care of somebody else, you're not living. You're a servant. That's a fucking problem. It's no different than the stay at home mom that never does self care. We need that. Men need that, right?"

Here are some of the MOST ANNOYING things that a neighbour can do\u2026 The last one would probably get to me the most. \ud83e\udee3 1. Play loud music, have a party and watch tv with the volume up high. 2. Loud building work, use noisy tools and mow the lawn too early in the morning. 3. Block the driveway or park in a space that isn\u2019t theirs. 4. Leave mess or rubbish outside the front of the home and leave front gardens looking unkept. 5. Letting cats outside to do their business in the neighbour\u2019s garden and taking the dog for a walk nearby and not picking up after them.  Have you ever experienced any of the above?

The decor is incredible, the food has so much flavour and the service was outstanding. I went to the ladies bathroom and was so mesmerised by the decor that my husband had to message me to see if I was alright because I was gone so long. Haha! I\u2019ve never seen a bathroom like it. I left feeling inspired to make bolder decor choices at home and to try out new recipes in the kitchen this year. Do you like to experiment with colour at home? Or will you be trying out any new dishes in the kitchen? FOLLOW for more home inspo & SAVE this for later.

That\u2019s why I decided to go for an induction hob. Cleaning it is just a breeze. Spills are easily wiped up and when I need to clean under the sides of it, I use a butter knife wrapped in kitchen roll. I stay away from beautiful chandeliers and small tiles with white grout. Far too much work for me. \ud83d\ude05 Have you ever regretted buying something that\u2019s just a nightmare to clean? FOLLOW for more inspo & SAVE this for later.

And the next step is going to be straining off the solids from the liquid, which is going to be our tallow. Now, you know it is ready when all of the solids left over flash, any flash, sinks completely to the bottom of the Crock Pot, and that's how you know it's ready to go. So I'm gonna turn this off, unplug it, and we're gonna start the straining process. And all I have here is a metal bowl, because it's kind of flexible, so I can get the towel out once it solidifies, and a find my strainer with some cheesecloth in the middle. Now, you're going to want to work slowly and carefully, because this is hot. When I started personally using Talo Lotion, I noticed immediate results. Skin was smoother and tighter. I had an overall healthier glow. So I have strained everything, and now I'm just gonna let this sit and cool. Gonna let it cool overnight, and it's gonna completely solidify. And then we will go ahead and clean the puck of tallow once that happens.",

          "video_description": "A slightly more realistic one for this trend \ud83d\ude09 In stories we've been talking about all the videos we've been seeing recently where people are claiming they've made thousands, even hundreds of thousands from posting a simple video of them driving or drinking coffee. While that sounds wonderful, that isn't the story of most of us content creators on here.  In reality, most of us content creators who are making money are posting higher quality content that takes longer to make, trying to create valuable digital products, and in general bring value to people's lives. I think of @reallyverycrunchy for example - her social media is her livelihood, but look at the work she puts into her videos!  Anyway, as someone who has been creating content on IG for about 5 years, and who started actively putting work and time into this account one year ago, I thought this \"what I made\" video would be helpful for you.  If you've been wondering how to make money on instagram - I don't have a course or guide to sell you. IG does not monetize! I've only been able to bring in money via my Patreon (where I am also constantly creating valuable content), and affiliates (I made $400 this year from affiliates). So, if you want to make money online, maybe work on building up a following and then create digital products that hit your audience's pain points.  It's all about value. \u2764 #tradwife #traditionalwife #contentcreator "

But in lieu of a recent article of a woman sharing her story about how she\u2019s getting a divorce because her husband became infatuated with a content creator and started having an affair, I have to say, that kind of behavior from men is NOT WELCOME HERE. I identify as a trad wife in that I PERSONALLY find joy and fulfillment in my traditionally gendered role within the home. There is NOTHING wrong with that. What IS wrong is insisting that ALL women will find fulfillment in this role, and that is not the case! I am here to uplift ladies who are ALREADY like myself, I am not here to say everyone MUST live this way, because that\u2019s not realistic. I am here to teach. I am here to inspire. And I am here to be a safe haven in our chaotic world. So if you are a GUY who is in want of a \u201ctrad wife\u201d please ask yourself: why? Are you the type of man someone would want to take care of? What are your goals? Do you view marriage as a team with and agreed upon structure or as just a hierarchy of authority? And lastly and MOST importantly, the women currently in your life and the ones who have left\u2026 what are their thoughts of you? - Their answers will be the most telling and you will may need humility and meekness to learn from their answers. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 #tradwife #tradwifetok #tradwivesoftiktok #tradwives #homemaker #homemaking #sahm ",

But, uh, let's talk about the May Lee's B flat body lotion thing. So Maile sent this to me as a free sample. This is marketed as a firming belly cream, and there are a lot of positive reviews out there here on TikTok, especially some very, very, very shocking and positive, uh, before and after pictures. This product does not make you lose weight. It does not make you lose belly fat. But what it is going to do is make it a little bit more exciting for you to take care of your skin and to get that moisture in your skin that your skin needs. This does heat up and tingle on the skin. So if you're the type of person that likes to feel something, to feel like it's working, then you are going to like this product. But bottom line, what this does is it helps get your skin nice and nourished, moisturized and healthy so that it can go and look great. So I do like it.",

I do think this is a fun product to make selfcare more exciting. It smells good, a bit too much for me, but it fades, and it does warm up and tingle which i like!

          "video_description": "\"Tradwife\" is a fairly inclusive, yet exclusive term. We all look different - some of us wear prairie style clothes, some 1950s, others just modern clothes.  Some of us have children, others don't.  Some of us homestead and live in the country, and others live in the city.  Some of us rely 100% on our husband's income, some of us work!  None of these things define us as traditional wives, and really, all of that is traditional. Even working - women have been working for all of time!  I think the main thing is that as traditional wives, we seek to follow God's design for the family. We respect our husbands as the main breadwinner and the head of the home. As wives, we see our roles as the help meet - and what we do as helper to our husbands will vary from family to family. Our homes are our priority - and our families even more so. Tending to the home is primarily our role as wives, so, we prioritize that over our hobbies or jobs.  And lastly, we believe God designed men and women with completely separate sets of abilities, talents, and roles. We are not interchangeable but complimentary to one another. This often drives much of our lifestyles.  P.S. I understand that, while much of this post is true, I may not be speaking for every woman who calls herself a traditional wife. This is mainly what I believe and have observed from others in the community, but I understand that there are caveats and varying opinions. My word is not the gospel truth, so please don't think that I believe it is. \u2764\ufe0f #tradwife #traditionalwife #homemaker "

And he said this happens quite often, that people neglect to bring food for themselves. He said that the wardens are probably going to be uncomfortable watching me not have any food for the next 20 years to life, and that he could probably ease their discomfort by bring me a sandwich or something. He said his hope is that I will be hungry and that nobody will give me food, and that that will just show me the natural outcome of being a piece of shit abusive mom who deprives others of basic nutrition. Hopefully this teaches my psycho bitch self a lesson.",

Even if you use mattress protectors, it\u2019ll help prevent staining but that other stuff still finds a way.  But by vacuuming it regularly, (some say monthly and others, every 6 months) we can reduce the amount of dust and dirt on our mattresses. Tip!  If you sprinkle bicarb on your mattress and leave it for a few hours before vacuuming. It helps to kill bacteria and leaves it smelling fresher. How often do you vacuum your mattress?

They're freeze dried, so all of the ingredients are preserved until they get to you. And the mask is in a little tray. You add a little bit of water, let it sit for about a minute, that activates all the ingredients so that you can then apply the mask. And I feel like because of that, they're really easy to kinda stick. Like you can make it as thick as you want, it's not super watery and it really holds onto your face. It's not wiggling around. And they really do smooth your skin and feel amazing."

The first few times he brought donuts, and then he brought fruit or bottles of water and packets of Kool Aid. Although it might sound odd for him to bring those things, in my eyes they were the best. Having to live on rations from week to week, simple things like donuts and Kool Aid were luxury items. And we're not included in our weekly ration crates. Our weekly ration crates included flour, powdered milk, rice, oranges, Tang, potatoes, canned beans, dried peas, and a week's supply of some of the other vegetable or another. Sometimes it was broccoli or green beans. Other times it would be asparagus or carrots. It wasn't the best food, and it soon became boring to eat over and over every single week. But I couldn't complain. There were no such things as grocery stores anymore. So the usual things I like to eat, I no longer existed. I had been seeing Connor every day for over a month and my parents being questioning what I was doing every day. They didn't question my whereabouts at first because they just assumed I was a regular, bored 18 year old who needed to get out. They trusted me a lot."

Cleaning my oven is always a huge burden and it takes forever, but with the Pummy scouring stick it took like maybe a half an hour. This oven cleaning tip didn't use any harsh chemicals and didn't require me to use the sometimes dangerous self cleaning feature on my oven. You only need to use a very light pressure. Look just with my finger scouring stick didn't scratch my oven at all. So long as you just use water and the stick you should be good to go. I didn't get my oven one hundred percent perfect after all. I don't want it to be 100% perfect because it isn't often that I use regularly and I want it to look like I actually cook in my home. But I do have to say that I am very, very impressed by this hack. Give it a try!",

So what are some things that you would outline as being, like, true domestic violence? There is the school of thought that violence is only physical. Right? And it's not. I think over the last, you know, couple decades, do they really look at the effects of physical abuse as well as psychological abuse or financial abuse and all of those things? And. And there's a really wonderful graphic called The Power and Control Wheel. I don't know if you're familiar with it, but it. It kind of outlines the different areas that, um, someone who is perpetrating any sort of domestic violence is going to kind of take hold of the situation and hold on to the situation. And to me, that would be abuse. Any. Anything that robs you of your power in a situation where it should be equal, to me, feels like an abuse of power."

I saw that Facebook post yesterday and I knew immediately that it was user error. Emmanuel says that you must always put the car seat in the locked position when the car is in motion. And something that a lot of parents, myself included, is. We tend to just keep it in the unlocked position because it's convenient to put your kid in and out of. And sometimes I'll get in the car and I don't have my son with me and it's still in the unlocked position. The comments of that Facebook post, they were claiming that the seat was locked. It wasn't. It's right here in the photo from that exact post I screenshotted. The indicator says it's unlocked and the car seat rotates and it's in the locked position. You have metal bars that I circled here that are locking the scene place. Jamie Grayson has posted a lot of videos about this. I suggest you go check his videos out. But I'm not worried about this car seat at all.",

          "video_description": "This is a bit of a controversial topic but I like to prepare when we have a guest coming over to visit.  Especially, when I know that they notice these 3 things\u2026 Stick around for the last one, it\u2019s a true story\u2026 1. The smell of your home Apparently, we become nose-blind to our own home smell. But when you walk into someone\u2019s home, it\u2019s often one of the first things that you notice as a guest.  It will either be a nice smell or one that\u2019s not so great.  So I like to change the bins regularly and open windows to help keep my home smelling fresh. 2. Bathroom cleanliness  The bathroom is said to be the first place you should clean when expecting guests. A not so clean bathroom can be off putting for guests. Especially when it\u2019s not theirs. Once I used someone\u2019s loo and there wasn\u2019t any loo roll. Luckily, I had backup! I clean mine daily and always double check it before a guest uses it because I\u2019ve got children using it regularly. 3. Pet hair As a previous dog owner, I know pet hair can get everywhere and can also stick to your guests once they sit on your sofa.  I was once invited for dinner by someone who had a couple of dogs and my plate had several pet hairs on it. \ud83e\udee3 When I had a dog, I used to vacuum more frequently to make sure the house wasn\u2019t covered in pet hair. Have you always had a positive experience when you\u2019ve been a guest in someone\u2019s home? FOLLOW for more like this & SAVE for later.

The man apologized, subheading, I said there was no problem. We kept talking about other things as they went in, he stayed out doing his stuff. Shortly thereafter, his wife came out to call him.
